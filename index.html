            <h1>Indigenous Women on the Web</h1>
            <p>A collection of profiles of indigenous women from around the world.  To be indigenous is not exclusive to the US or Canada.  Defining who indigenous peoples are can be prolematic.  Idigenous for this collection refers to a people which have cultural ties to the land and natural resources where they or ancestors orginated from.</p>

        <h2>Elizabeth Peratrovich</h2>

            <div class=" div-1 flex-third-width">
                <p>Elizabeth Peratrovich—whose Tlingit name is Kaaxgal.aat, a member of the Lukaax̱.ádi clan of the Raven moiety—was born on July 4, 1911 in Petersburg, Alaska during a time of extensive segregation in the territory. She was lovingly raised by adoptive parents, living in various small Southeast Alaska communities throughout her childhood.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="div-2 flex-third-width">
                <p>Elizabeth played an instrumental role in passing the first anti-discrimination law in the US. Elizabeth took to the floor of the Alaska Senate to deliver an impassioned call for equal treatment for Indigenous peoples. She was met with thunderous applause and her moving testimony is widely credited as a decisive factor in the passage of the historic Anti-Discrimination Act of 1945.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="div-3 flex-third-width">
                <p>Fun fact:  In 1988 the Alaska State Legislature declared February 16 as “<em>Elizabeth Peratrovich Day</em>”, and in 2020 the United States Mint released a $1 gold coin inscribed with Elizabeth’s likeness in honor of her historic achievements in the fight for equality. </p>

            <h1>Google Doodle of Elizabeth</h1>
            <img src="img/celebrating-elizabeth-peratrovich.png">
            <p>Elizabeth was celebrated by Google Doodle on December 30<sup>th</sup>, 2020.  This introduced her legacy to a whole new audience.  
                The Doodle illustration was created by  Michaela Goade a Tlingit artist based in Sitka, Alaska.  She grew up hearing Elizabeth Peratrovich's 
                name often, both in the community and also within her family. Michaela's early family history intertwines with Elizabeth's as she was a 
                friend to her great-aunts, and she was often told that she shared a distant familial connection. Elizabeth Peratrovich is admired by 
                Michaela for her strength, intelligence, courage and compassion.</p>
